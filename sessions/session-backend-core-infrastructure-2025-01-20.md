This session established both backend and frontend foundations that will support real-time multiplayer gameplay via Socket.io.

## Implementation Summary

### 🎯 Core Components Delivered

#### 1. Express Application Framework (`src/app.ts`)
```typescript
// Security-first approach with game-specific configurations
- Helmet security middleware with CSP for WebSocket communication
- CORS configuration optimized for frontend-backend communication
- Request parsing with 10MB limit (future card image support)
- Request timeout (30s) and unique ID tracking for monitoring
- Environment-aware configuration (development vs production modes)
```

**Key Features:**
- Production-ready security headers via Helmet
- Game-optimized CORS policy for real-time communication
- Request size limits appropriate for card game assets
- Timeout protection for long-running operations

#### 2. Environment Management (`src/config/environment.ts`)
```typescript
// Zod-based validation with comprehensive error handling
const envSchema = z.object({
  NODE_ENV: z.enum(['development', 'test', 'production']).default('development'),
  PORT: z.string().default('3001').transform(Number),
  DATABASE_URL: z.string(),
  REDIS_URL: z.string(),
  JWT_SECRET: z.string().min(32),
  // ... 15+ validated environment variables
});
```

**Technical Highlights:**
- Runtime validation for 15+ environment variables
- Type-safe configuration with automatic string-to-number transforms
- Production safety checks for critical secrets (JWT, database SSL)
- Clear error messages for missing or invalid configuration

#### 3. Health Monitoring System (`src/routes/health.ts`)
Comprehensive health endpoints for monitoring and debugging:

```typescript
GET /health          // Basic service status and version
GET /health/db       // Database connectivity with response times
GET /health/detailed // System metrics (memory, CPU, uptime)
GET /health/stats    // Game-specific statistics (users, cards, decks)
```

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Basic health checks for load balancer integration
- Database connectivity verification with performance metrics
- System resource monitoring (memory usage, uptime)
- Game-specific metrics ready for operational dashboards

#### 4. Error Handling Architecture (`src/middleware/`)

**Comprehensive Error Handler (`errorHandler.ts`):**
- Zod validation error parsing with field-specific messages
- Prisma database error handling (connection, constraint violations)
- JWT authentication error management
- Structured error responses with development/production differentiation

**Async Request Wrapper (`asyncHandler.ts`):**
- Automatic Promise rejection handling
- Eliminates try-catch boilerplate in route handlers
- Ensures all async errors are properly caught and handled

**Request Validation (`validateRequest.ts`):**
- Reusable Zod schema validation middleware
- Body, query, and parameter validation support
- Structured validation error responses

#### 5. Logging Infrastructure (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
Production-ready Winston configuration:

```typescript
// File rotation and structured logging
- Error logs: 5MB rotation with 5 file retention
- Combined logs: 10MB rotation with 10 file retention
- Development: Colorized console output with timestamps
- Production: JSON structured logging with metadata
- Specialized loggers: DB, HTTP, Game, Auth components
```

#### 6. Server Management (`src/server.ts`)
Robust server lifecycle management:

```typescript
// Graceful shutdown implementation
- SIGTERM/SIGINT signal handling
- Database connection cleanup
- 10-second forced shutdown timeout
- Process cleanup and resource release
```

### 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Database Integration**: Used existing Prisma client instead of implementing raw PostgreSQL connection
2. **Environment Validation**: Implemented Zod transform chains with `default().transform()` pattern for type safety
3. **Middleware Architecture**: Created modular structure for future authentication and Socket.io integration
4. **Error Classification**: Comprehensive error type handling covering all expected error sources
5. **Security Configuration**: Helmet headers appropriate for real-time game applications
6. **Logging Strategy**: Production-ready Winston with proper rotation and multiple transports

## 🐛 Database Troubleshooting Resolution

### TypeScript Strict Mode Issues in Prisma Seed

**Problem Identified**:
- `npm run db:seed` failing with 15 TypeScript errors
- `TS2532: Object is possibly 'undefined'` on array element access
- Caused by `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` in TypeScript strict mode

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```typescript
// Problem: TypeScript couldn't statically prove array length
const humanCards = testCards.filter(card => card.faction === 'humans');
humanCards[0].id  // TypeScript: "possibly undefined"
```

**Solution Implemented**:
```typescript
// Fix: Non-null assertions with safety comments
const humanCards = testCards.filter(card => card.faction === 'humans');
// Safe array access: we know we created exactly 5 human cards above
humanCards[0]!.id  // Non-null assertion for known-safe access
```

**Additional Fix**: Corrected DeckCard creation logic
- **Issue**: Attempting to create multiple DeckCard entries for same card
- **Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of composite primary key `[deckId, cardId]`
- **Solution**: Single DeckCard entry per card with quantity field

**Verification**: Database seeding now works perfectly with all faction test data
