# Card Component Unification Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a unified card component for the TCG Tactique application that works seamlessly across all three contexts: game battlefield, collection browser, and deck builder. The component will combine classic TCG card layout with the application's Gothic theme while maintaining responsive design and optimal performance.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the application has:
- A sophisticated game card component (`/frontend/src/components/game/Card.tsx`) with drag-and-drop functionality
- Mock card implementations in Collection and Deck Builder pages with inconsistent styling
- Duplicate styling and layout logic across different contexts
- No unified visual identity for cards across the application

## Solution Goals

1. **Single Component Architecture**: One unified component serving all three contexts
2. **Classic TCG Layout**: Art-prominent layout following traditional TCG card proportions (5:7 aspect ratio)
3. **Gothic Theme Preservation**: Maintain all existing Gothic styling elements and atmospheric effects
4. **Context-Aware Functionality**: Appropriate interactions and features for each context
5. **Responsive Design**: Consistent scaling across all screen sizes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Design
**Objective**: Design unified component architecture supporting classic TCG layout with Gothic theme preservation.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Component interface design with context-aware props
- Classic TCG layout specification (5:7 aspect ratio)
- Gothic theme integration strategy
- Responsive sizing system
- Animation and interaction patterns

**Duration**: 2-3 days

### Phase 2: Layout Implementation
**Objective**: Implement classic TCG card layout with integrated Gothic theme styling.

**Key Deliverables**:
- CSS Grid-based layout system with proper proportions
- Art-prominent design (40-45% of card height)
- Faction-specific color system integration
- Atmospheric effects (scanlines, glows, shadows)
- Typography scaling system

**Duration**: 3-4 days

### Phase 3: Context Integration
**Objective**: Integrate unified component across all application contexts.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Game context integration with drag-and-drop preservation
- Collection page integration replacing mock cards
- Deck builder integration with add/remove functionality
- Context-specific interaction handlers
- Migration strategy and implementation

**Duration**: 4-5 days

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**Objective**: Ensure quality, performance, and accessibility across all contexts.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive unit and integration test suite
- Visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Cross-browser compatibility validation

**Duration**: 2-3 days

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **React DnD** for drag-and-drop (game context)
- **CSS Grid** for layout structure

### Design System
- **Aspect Ratio**: 5:7 (classic TCG proportions)
- **Color System**: Faction-specific Gothic color palette
- **Typography**: Gothic and tech font families
- **Effects**: Scanlines, glows, atmospheric elements
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with desktop enhancements

### Performance Targets
- **Render Time**: < 16ms per card
- **Grid Performance**: < 100ms for 50+ cards
- **Animation**: Consistent 60fps
- **Bundle Impact**: < 50KB increase
- **Memory Usage**: < 1MB for 100 cards

## Context-Specific Requirements

### Game Context
- Battlefield grid compatibility
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Resource/affordability checking
- Turn-based interaction states
- Hand position management

### Collection Context
- Browse and selection functionality
- Search/filter integration
- Responsive grid layout (2-6 columns)
- Large dataset handling (360 cards)

### Deck Builder Context
- Add/remove deck functionality
- Quantity tracking and limits (max 2 per card)
- Faction filtering integration
- Deck validation (exactly 40 cards)

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Test Coverage**: > 90% for core component
- **Integration Testing**: All context scenarios covered
- **Visual Testing**: Snapshot and regression testing
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking and profiling
