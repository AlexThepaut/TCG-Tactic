# Phase 3: Game Mechanics

## Overview
Feature-by-feature implementation of core game mechanics with parallel backend/frontend development.

## Tasks
- **1.3A**: Card System Foundation - Backend card models and seed data
- **1.3B**: Unit Placement Backend - Placement logic with validation
- **1.3C**: Click-Based Card Placement Interface - Frontend card placement UI with two-step interaction
- **1.3D**: Combat Logic Engine - Backend combat calculations
- **1.3E**: Combat User Interface - Frontend combat interactions
- **1.3F**: Turn Management System - Backend turn cycle management
- **1.3G**: Game UI Integration - Complete game interface assembly

## Execution Strategy
1. Start backend foundation (1.3A, 1.3B)
2. Parallel frontend development (1.3C while 1.3B completes)
3. Combat system implementation (1.3D, 1.3E in parallel)
4. Turn management and final integration (1.3F, 1.3G)

## Success Criteria
Complete playable game with all mechanics functional.
