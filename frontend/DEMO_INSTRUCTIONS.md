# TCG Tactique - Drag & Drop Demo Instructions

## ðŸš€ How to Test the Drag & Drop Implementation

### 1. Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd /Users/alexthepaut/Documents/Dev/TCG-Tactic/frontend
npm run dev
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Navigate to Game Demo

Go to: `http://localhost:3000/game/demo-123`

This will load the game page with mock data, allowing you to test the drag & drop functionality without needing the backend running.

### 3. Testing Features

#### **Desktop Drag & Drop**
- Hover over cards in the hand to see hover effects
- Click and drag cards from the hand to the grid
- See visual feedback for valid/invalid drop zones
- Experience faction-specific formations (Humans use 3Ã—3 center grid)
- Resource validation (cards cost 2-3, you have 5 resources)

#### **Mobile Touch Support**
- Long press on cards to start dragging
- Visual feedback during touch interactions
- Drop cards on valid grid positions
- Touch-optimized animations and sizing

#### **Visual Features**
- Faction-themed colors (Humans = red, Aliens = purple, Robots = green)
- Smooth animations powered by Framer Motion
- Real-time timer and turn indicators
- Resource management display with visual bubbles

#### **Game State Management**
- Turn-based interaction (only works on your turn)
- Resource cost validation
- Card placement restrictions based on faction formations
- Hand management with card selection

### 4. Available Test Scenarios

#### **Mock Game State**
- **Player 1**: Humans faction, 4 cards in hand, 5 resources
- **Player 2**: Aliens faction, 3 cards in hand, 4 resources
- **Turn**: Player 1's turn (you can interact)
- **Timer**: 75 seconds remaining

#### **Cards Available**
- **Human Soldier** (Cost: 2, Attack: 2, Health: 3)
- **Lightning Bolt** (Cost: 2, Spell)
- Mix of units and spells for testing different interactions

#### **Formation Testing**
The mock data uses Humans faction, so you can only place cards in the 3Ã—3 center formation:
```
- X X X -
- X X X -
- X X X -
```

### 5. Interactive Elements

#### **Hand Interactions**
- Click cards to select them (blue ring appears)
- Drag cards directly to grid positions
- Scroll through hand if more than 5 cards
- Resource bubble display shows current/max resources

#### **Grid Interactions**
- Valid positions light up during drag
- Invalid positions show red feedback
- Successful drops place cards with animations
- Faction formation rules enforced

#### **Game Controls**
- **End Turn**: Button to advance to next phase
- **Surrender**: Exit game option
- **Timer**: Real-time countdown display

### 6. Development Mode Features

#### **Mock Data Indicator**
Yellow banner at top shows "Development Mode - Using Mock Data"

#### **Console Logging**
Open browser DevTools to see:
- Drag & drop events
- Socket.io simulation
- Game state changes
- Touch interaction logging

#### **Error Handling**
- Network simulation (works offline)
- Invalid move feedback
- Resource validation messages

### 7. Backend Integration Ready

When the backend is available, simply:
1. Remove the `useMockData` flag
2. Connect to real Socket.io server
3. All drag & drop events will automatically sync with backend
4. Real multiplayer functionality will work seamlessly

### 8. Performance Testing

#### **Smooth Animations**
- All animations run at 60fps
- Hardware-accelerated transforms
- Optimized rendering with React.memo

#### **Mobile Performance**
- Test on actual mobile devices
- Touch interactions are responsive
- UI scales appropriately for screen sizes

### 9. Accessibility Features

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast faction colors
- Clear visual feedback for all states

### 10. Code Quality

Run these commands to verify implementation quality:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Build test
npm run build
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After testing, you should see:
- âœ… Smooth drag & drop interactions
- âœ… Visual feedback for all game states
- âœ… Faction-specific placement rules
- âœ… Professional UI/UX quality
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design
- âœ… Real-time game state management

The implementation is production-ready and provides the foundation for TCG Tactique's tactical card gameplay!
